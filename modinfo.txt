	Name: Alternate Balance Expansion Mod [EXPERIMENTAL]
	Description: <<
		[b][h1]0.5.0 Alpha[/h1][/b]
		[b]Testing focus is on the following things:[/b][list]
		[*]Power Balance and Design Stats - Weapons and various other subsystems now require the ship-local Power resource instead of draining Energy from the imperial reserve or permanently reducing Power generation. Balancing is far from final or complete. Various subsystems may not yet have been correctly reworked to utilize the new mechanic.
		[*]FTL Balance and Design Stats - Hyperdrives and Slipstream Generators now require the ship-local FTL Energy resource instead of draining FTL from the imperial reserve (which has been renamed to FTL Crystals) to operate. Ships can store a certain amount of FTL Crystals and resupply in friendly systems, and can gain FTL Energy by consuming Crystals or through emergency generation from Power.
		[*]New Graphics - Multiple vanilla graphics have been replaced or reduced in frequency. There may be occurrences where an icon either hasn't been properly assigned or has not yet been updated to the correct image. (For example, Shield Generator subsystems have a new icon, but not all references to the subsystem may have been updated accordingly. Fixes for a lot of these should have come/be coming in the next patches, testing or no testing. :P)
		[*]Miscellaneous - There's been a lot of changes Alar's been doing that I can't categorize, and I'm not sure what works or doesn't work anymore.[/list]

		Feedback and suggestions are welcome. (Especially suggestions about Power or FTL - Alar seems to want to do something 'more' with those, but can't think of anything. Suffice to say, it's not helping when the only one [i]really[/i] balancing this stuff isn't balancing it because he considers it temporary.)
