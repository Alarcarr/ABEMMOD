# ABEMMOD

How to use the various branches:

Master: This branch is used to implement new features intended for the next major release.

Release: This branch is the current Workshop version.

Slave: This branch is used to implement bug fixes before pushing directly to the Workshop. (And the release branch.)

A good analogy would be the layout of Star Trek Online's servers when preparing for a new major update. Redshirt is the 'slave' branch (except our slave branch is always online, unlike Redshirt), Holodeck is the 'release' branch, and Tribble is the 'master' branch. The difference is that the master branch never takes on the properties of the slave branch, whereas Tribble sometimes takes Redshirt's role when it's not being used to test major content, resulting in the shutdown of Redshirt.
