# Alternate Balance Expansion Mod

Instructions for modders forking this:

1. Create a .steam file containing the line "355873534" in the root directory of your working copy. (Where the repository's .git folder is located.) This will prevent you from accidentally pushing your work to the Workshop instead of GitHub.

2. Create a modinfo.txt in the root directory of your working copy. Its contents are irrelevant, so long as they are valid. (If needed, check the readme's commit history - one of the commits contains a removed modinfo.txt that you can use, along with a removed .steam file.)

3. Download the ABEM Modding Toolkit, either from the Steam Workshop or by pulling the latest #STEAM commit from https://github.com/DaloLorn/SR2Mods/tree/ABEMTool. It's got a few useful tweaks for the mod editor that could come in handy.
