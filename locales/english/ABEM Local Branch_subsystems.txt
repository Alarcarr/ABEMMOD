	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides a [b][color=#0f0]high[/color][/b] [color=#fefc61]Resupply Rate[/color][/b], somewhat lower than that of Antimatter Generators.[/img]
	[img=Plus]No maintenance cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very high construction and labor costs.[/img]
	>>
S_SUPERLASER_DESC: <<
	A powerful laser cannon capable of channeling enough power to destroy planets.

	[img=Plus]Very powerful.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Can target ships as well as planets, unlike the Buster Machine.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Extremely high power requirements.[/img]
	[img=Minus]High minimum size.[/img]

	[img=Minus]Very limited firing arc.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Requires high amounts of Control.[/img]
>>
S_ROBOTICSHIPYARD_DESC: <<
	Salvages raw materials from space, using them to construct new support ships.

	[img=Plus]Constructs support ships for its flagship at any location.[/img]

>>
	SHIELDGEN_DESC: <<
	Creates a shield around the vessel, blocking some incoming damage.

	[img=Plus]Creates regenerating barrier against damage.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Weakened shields allow some damage through.[/img]
>>
S_SUPSHIELD_DESC: <<
	Creates a shield around the vessel, blocking some incoming damage. This shield's capacitors must be charged by the support ship's inferior power supply, so it regenerates at a slower rate compared to flagship shielding.

	[img=Plus]Creates regenerating barrier against damage.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Weakened shields allow some damage through.[/img]
>>
S_COVARIANT_SHIELD_DESC: <<
	Creates a shield around the vessel, blocking some incoming damage. Covariant shields are more powerful, but they regenerate at a slower rate than their standard counterparts.

	[img=Plus]Creates regenerating barrier against damage.[/img]

	[img=Plus]Increased capacity.[/img]

S_QUANTUM_ARMOR_DESC: <<
	Neutronium armor mostly shifted out of our physical universe to reduce mass, only to reappear prior to impact and withstand the same amount of firepower.

	[img=Minus]Expensive.[/img]

>>
S_FLAK_DESC: <<
