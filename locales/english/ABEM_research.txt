	[color=#aaa][i]Carriers are good. Carriers carry lots of fighters, and we all know a single fighter can be enough to destroy a planet-killing superweapon.

	So, we've gone and developed some outstanding new ways of designing carrier hulls! We could probably do better, though - here, sign this research grant and we'll see what we can do.[/i][/color]
