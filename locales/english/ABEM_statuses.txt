	Fleet effectiveness reduced by 50% for 4 minutes.
>>
STATUS_MEL_DESC: <<
	Has had its energy signature masked by an Admiral's flagship.

	Apparent fleet DPS reduced by 1000 for 5 minutes, reducing strength. (Does not actually weaken the fleet.) Must be reapplied after expiration.
>>
STATUS_ABEMINFILTRATED_DESC: <<
	Is the victim of a covert insertion by a saboteur. While the saboteur's presence is known to the vessel's crew - or planetary defense coordinators - they lack the equipment and training required to capture him.

	Fleet effectiveness reduced by 10% (also applies to planetary defense fleets). The saboteur frequently transmits data to his superiors, granting vision of the star system.

>>
STATUS_ORB_EXP_PLATFORMS_DESC: This planet is being strip-mined by automated orbital exploitation platforms.
STATUS_PROGENITOR_COMPUTER_BOOST_DESC: Heavy computation done by the Progenitor-designed control computer aboard the flagship is significantly increasing this fleet's efficiency and combat strength for the first 60 seconds of any combat.
STATUS_CLOAKED_DESC: <<
	This fleet is currently cloaked, and cannot be seen from distances in excess of 100 units.

	Cloaking costs a small amount of energy per second to maintain and breaks as soon as the fleet enters combat. Additionally, the fleet's sensor range is reduced by 65% with a priority of 500.
>>
STATUS_READYFORHARVEST: Ready for Harvesting
STATUS_READYFORHARVEST_DESC: <<

	Generates 15 Research per second and 100 Labor per minute. Can import Labor, has 5000 Labor storage, and can construct anything like a planet would.
>>
STATUS_GUARDIANSHIPYARD_BUILDING: Construction Mode
STATUS_GUARDIANSHIPYARD_BUILDING_DESC: <<
	This Guardian Facility is fabricating and storing modules for the assembly of a Guardian.

	Consumes 10 Energy and 2.5 FTL per second, and incurs a maintenance cost of ยง2M. Construction will be canceled without any refund if the facility shuts down or is donated to another empire. Lasts a minimum of 15 minutes before allowing the Guardian's construction to be completed.
>>
STATUS_BROKENSEEDSHIP: Crashed Seed Ship
STATUS_BROKENSEEDSHIP_DESC: <<
	A damaged seed ship was successfully guided to the planet's surface. Study of the ship's systems yields a 10% boost to civilian Research production and 2 Research generation on the planet, and interfacing with the ship's computer allows periodic fabrication of artifacts.
