	Fleet effectiveness reduced by 50% for 4 minutes.
>>
STATUS_MEL_DESC: <<
	Has had its energy signature masked by an Admiral's flagship.

	Apparent fleet DPS reduced by 1000 for 5 minutes, reducing strength. (Does not actually weaken the fleet.) Must be reapplied after expiration.
>>
STATUS_ABEMINFILTRATED_DESC: <<
	Is the victim of a covert insertion by a saboteur. While the saboteur's presence is known to the vessel's crew - or planetary defense coordinators - they lack the equipment and training required to capture him.

STATUS_DEFENSIVEMATRIX_DESC: <<
	This ship has received additional shielding from a Defensive Matrix Generator on a nearby flagship.
>>
STATUS_ENVOY: Diplomatic Expedition
STATUS_ENVOY_DESC: <<

>>
STATUS_ORB_EXP_PLATFORMS_DESC: This planet is being strip-mined by automated orbital exploitation platforms.
STATUS_PROGENITOR_COMPUTER_BOOST_DESC: Heavy computation done by the Progenitor-designed control computer aboard the flagship is significantly increasing this fleet's efficiency and combat strength for the first 60 seconds of any combat.
STATUS_CLOAKED_DESC: <<
	This fleet is currently cloaked, and cannot be seen from distances in excess of 100 units.
