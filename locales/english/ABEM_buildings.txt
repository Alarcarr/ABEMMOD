>>
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON: Ancient Gravitational Collapser
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON_DESC: <<|
	A reactivated ancient weapon of considerable firepower.

	If operational, fires a projectile every 10 seconds, dealing between 500 and 37500 damage to all targets within 50 units of the explosion, depending on their size. Size 100 ships will take 2500 damage per hit, size 20 or smaller will take 500 damage per hit, size 1500 or larger will take 37500 damage per hit.

	If the planet is under siege and has no defenses remaining in orbit, the weapon is deactivated.
>>
BLD_RECALL_DESC: <<
	A hyperfield manipulator designed to open a wormhole between a location in orbit and any allied object in the universe.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Grants the Recall ability.[/img]
	[img=ResourceIcon::2;20]Costs [b][color=#42b4bd]Energy[/color][/b] to activate.[/img]

>>
BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL: Portal Stabilizer
BLD_VANGUARDPORTAL_DESC: <<
	A powerful hyperfield manipulator of tremendous scale. When activated and targeted at a specific point in space along with two other Stabilizers, this structure will create a massive wormhole through which the Overlords' invasion force can enter this galaxy.

	[img=ShieldImpactLarge*#de12de;20]Constructing three Portal Stabilizers will cause you to win a Vanguard Victory.[/img]
	[img=Plus;20]The presence of a Portal Stabilizer inspires the owner's race to fight harder to defend the system, manifesting as a 40% boost to fleet effectiveness to all owned fleets in the system.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Intense rivalry between Vanguard races - and the desire of non-Vanguard races to keep the Overlords away - cause the Stabilizer to self-destruct or be destroyed, respectively, when the planet's owner changes for any reason.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Can only be constructed once per planet, and can only be constructed on a Ringworld or Artificial Planetoid.[/img]
