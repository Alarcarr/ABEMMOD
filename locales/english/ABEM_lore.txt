It has been a long time since our slumber began.

We know not what has transpired in our absence, both on this world and throughout the galaxy; much has been lost, and of the countless billions of people on my world, only a handful remain.
I have begun leading the reconstruction. With time, we shall return to the stars we once so proudly ruled.

For now, however, we must concentrate our efforts elsewhere.
With the database nearly obliterated, much of what we once knew is a mystery once again. We know more of what can be achieved than how to achieve it.
Worse still, this once fertile world is no longer capable of supporting the civilization we once had - with a short supply of food and water, we must hurry to build starships to transport resources from other worlds.

I had considered evacuating to a more appropriate planet.

I should not have done so. There is an abundance of useful substances here - the rich cyllium deposits here could help us recreate some of our technology or channel the vast amounts of energy required to reactivate the artifacts of old.
If we are fortunate, we may even be able to reuse some of that energy in the matter fabricators. Ships may be easier to come by than I anticipated.

Our luck does not come without a high price, though. While we retain the scientific knowledge needed to travel amongst the stars, our infrastructure is abysmal.
The methods we use to obtain our resources these days have not been used for millennia [i]before[/i] we first developed spaceflight.
With time, we may learn again. I can only hope so.

When we were preserved in stasis, we launched many fleets of Keepers to protect our interests during our long sleep.

Had we known of their survival, or how lacking their abilities were...

In order to communicate effectively with the scouts we sent out to explore the system, we had to rebuild our communication systems.
Finally, we heard it - a signal from one of the Keepers. Even now they remain vigilant, ensuring the safety of so much Ulthaar technology...
Perhaps, if it becomes necessary, we shall call upon the Keepers to protect their builders.
If only we had the command codes for the greatest of the Keepers - the Guardians that stand watch above our hubworlds - or the seed ships that scatter our technology for all to use...
They would be of more use to us than any others.

What concerns me now, however, is that new life has made this galaxy its home during our eons of sleep.
Life that may fear us. Act against us. Withhold vital resources.

The question remains: Will they join us as we rebuild...

... or will they seek to end us?
