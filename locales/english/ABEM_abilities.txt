ABL_INFILTRATE_DESC: <<
	Uses a high amount of energy to teleport a well-trained saboteur onto a flagship or orbital, or into a planetary defense center to disrupt its operations and transmit its sensor data back to the empire. Can be used in tandem with the "Infiltrate" influence card.

	Training the saboteur and preparing his personal cloaking device costs §200k.
>>
ABL_GDF_DESC: <<
	Orders a flagship to overcharge its primary reactors. Boosts the damage output of the fleet, but the flagship is destroyed in a catastrophic overload.

	Effectiveness boost starts at 10%, increasing by 5% every 5 seconds until the ship explodes 60 seconds after activation. Explosion deals damage equivalent to the square root of 5*Power to all targets within a radius of the square root of 2*Power units. Cannot be used on a fleet that is under the effects of - or recovering from - Rally Cry.
>>
ABL_LW_DESC: <<
	Orders a fleet to redouble its efforts to defeat an enemy. The additional effort is a significant strain on the fleet's personnel and equipment, however, and they will need to recuperate before they can fight again.

	Boosts effectiveness by 2.5% every 5 seconds for 60 seconds, then halves effectiveness for 240 seconds. Rally Cry cannot be used on a fleet that is still recovering from a previous Rally Cry, or under the effects of Go Down Fighting.
>>
ABL_MEL_DESC: <<
	Uses special technology on the Admiral's flagship to mask the energy levels of a fleet, making them appear less powerful to an enemy's sensors. The deception must be maintained, though; every 5 minutes, the effect must be applied again.

	Reduces fleet's apparent DPS by 1000. Consumes 200 energy. Cannot stack.
>>
ABL_COUNTERINTEL_DESC: <<
	Uses a moderate amount of energy to disrupt the cloaking devices of saboteurs on a friendly flagship, orbital or planet and capture them. Also takes advantage of the empire's intelligence database to uncover and capture infiltrators from other empires aboard flagships.

	The operation costs §250k to perform.
>>
ABL_TURRET_LASER_DESC: <<
	Installs a laser turret onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turret's power generator prohibits the use of additional laser turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_TURRET_RAIL_DESC: <<
	Installs a pair of railgun turrets onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turrets' ammo fabricators, reloading mechanisms and induction coils prohibits the use of additional railgun turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_TURRET_MISSILE_DESC: <<
	Installs a dual missile turret onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turret's ammo fabricator prohibits the use of additional missile turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_BUILD_OUTPOST_DESC: <<
	Uses a moderate amount of energy to immediately fabricate an outpost at a target location.

	Preparing the components required for the project costs §300k. Evangelical races construct a Star Temple instead.
>>
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT_DESC: <<
	Sends a demolition crew to plant charges on the target derelict. The remains of the target ship are destroyed.
>>
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY: Send Boarding Party
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY_DESC: <<
	Transports a boarding party to the target object, initiating a boarding action.
	
	Boarding takes between 10 (overwhelming force on either side) and 100 (completely equal numbers) seconds to complete. If the defenders are defeated, control of the object is immediately transferred to the attacking empire. If not, nothing happens.
	
	Only one boarding action can be running on an object at any given time, and Verdant-owned objects cannot be boarded. Boarding actions cannot be initiated by ships which are already being boarded. Asteroids and orbitals always have 100 boarding strength.
>>
ABL_RECALL_DESC: Opens a wormhole engulfing the target allied object and immediately depositing it in close proximity to the recalling object.
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES: Override Remnant Programming
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES_DESC: <<
	Using our command codes, we can access the control computers of Keeper fleets, overriding the ancient directives programmed by our ancestors so that they do our bidding.
	
	Properly reactivating the fleets will require some energy, though, and we do not have the codes for the great Guardians that watch over the Hubworlds.
>>
ABL_DEFENSIVEMATRIX: Engage Defensive Matrix
ABL_DEFENSIVEMATRIX_DESC: <<
	Engulfs an allied flagship in a charged plasma field, absorbing incoming damage until the field dissipates.
	
	Adds a certain amount of shield HP and capacity to the target flagship or station. Lasts 60 seconds.
>>
ABL_HULLHEAL: Nano-Repair
ABL_HULLHEAL_DESC: <<
	Emits a stream of repair nanites towards an allied fleet, repairing their ships.
	
	Heals the target fleet, spreading the repairs evenly across the entire fleet. Drains 2 Supply for each HP of healing. If inactive, will automatically target the strongest allied fleet currently in combat, then shut down after combat has ceased.
>>
ABL_SHIELDHEAL: Regenerate Shields
ABL_SHIELDHEAL_DESC: <<
	Transmits a stream of energy towards an allied fleet, which is channeled into the fleet's shield generators, effectively regenerating their shields.
	
	Heals the target fleet's shields, spreading the regeneration evenly across all shield-capable ships. Drains 2 Supply for each HP of regeneration. If inactive, will automatically target the strongest allied fleet currently in combat, then shut down after combat has ceased.
>>
ABL_SUPPLYTRANSFER: Transfer Energy
ABL_SUPPLYTRANSFER_DESC: <<
	Transmits a stream of energy towards an allied fleet, which is stored in the target fleet's batteries.
	
	Transfers Supply to the target fleet.
>>
ABL_SHIELDTRANSFER: Transfer Shields
ABL_SHIELDTRANSFER_DESC: <<
	Bleeds off plasma from the flagship's shields, transmitting it towards an allied flagship for use.
	
	Transfers shield HP to the target flagship.
>>
ABL_DEPLOY_EXPLOITATION_PLATFORMS_DESC: <<
	Construct a number of orbital exploitation platforms to strip-mine a planet.

	Will automatically construct an amount of exploitation platforms to match the native resource level.
>>
ABL_CLOAK_DESC: <<
	Toggle whether the ship is currently cloaked.

	Cloaking makes the fleet invisible to anything more than 100 units away, but it costs a small amount of energy per second to maintain and breaks as soon as the fleet enters combat. Additionally, the fleet's sensor range is reduced by 65% at a priority of 500.
>>
ABL_ENGI_THRUSTER_DESC: <<
	Installs a set of maneuvering thrusters to the target orbital, giving it 1 u/s^2 of acceleration. Unfortunately, the system is too bulky to be installed more than once per orbital.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>
ABL_ENGI_SHIELD_DESC: <<
	Installs an array of shield generators onto the target orbital, giving it additional shield capacity dependent on its size and enough shield regeneration to regenerate the added shield to full capacity in 200 seconds. Unfortunately, the power requirements of the shield are too high for a second series of generators to be installed.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>
ABL_ENGI_SENSOR_DESC: <<
	Installs additional sensors onto the target orbital, giving it an additional 500 units of sensor range. However, the design of the sensors is such that the upgrade can only be performed once.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>
ABL_SPAWN_SUPPLYDEPOT_DESC: <<
	Uses a moderate amount of energy to immediately fabricate a supply depot at a target location.

	Preparing the components required for the project costs §500k.
>>
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST: Prepare Planet for Harvesting
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST_DESC: <<
	Tags any and all valuable resources on the planet surface for collection by a Ringworld. The process is a lengthy one; the beam must remain active for 6 consecutive minutes.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Deactivation of this ability, premature or not, incurs a 3 minute cooldown![/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Other Ringworlder empires can steal resources tagged by your ship.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Cannot target Barren planets, Ringworlds or Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
>>
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES: Harvest Planet
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES_DESC: <<
	Simultaneously transfers all valuable resources from a target planet and onto the Ringworld. The planet is left a barren wasteland and can then be consumed by a Harvester.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Planets must be marked by a Harvester using the 'Prepare Planet for Harvesting' ability.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Vast Plains and resources generated by the presence of Altars, Megafarms and Hydrogenators will not be affected, though other resources on those planets will.[/img]
>>
ABL_MINE_PLANET: Devour Planet
ABL_MINE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	A series of tractor beams and mining lasers harvest minerals from a barren planet until the planet is destroyed.

	Rapidly produces Ore. Can only target Barren planets. 2.5k Ore is generated for every 1G of damage to the planet.
