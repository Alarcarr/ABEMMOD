ABL_INFILTRATE_DESC: <<
	Uses a high amount of energy to teleport a well-trained saboteur onto a flagship or orbital, or into a planetary defense center to disrupt its operations and transmit its sensor data back to the empire. Can be used in tandem with the "Infiltrate" influence card.

	Training the saboteur and preparing his personal cloaking device costs §200k.
>>
ABL_GDF_DESC: <<
	Orders a flagship to overcharge its primary reactors. Boosts the damage output of the fleet, but the flagship is destroyed in a catastrophic overload.

	Effectiveness boost starts at 10%, increasing by 5% every 5 seconds until the ship explodes 60 seconds after activation. Explosion deals damage equivalent to the square root of 5*ReactorPower to all targets within a radius of the square root of 2*ReactorPower units. Cannot be used on a fleet that is under the effects of - or recovering from - Rally Cry.
>>
ABL_LW_DESC: <<
	Orders a fleet to redouble its efforts to defeat an enemy. The additional effort is a significant strain on the fleet's personnel and equipment, however, and they will need to recuperate before they can fight again.

	Boosts effectiveness by 2.5% every 5 seconds for 60 seconds, then halves effectiveness for 240 seconds. Rally Cry cannot be used on a fleet that is still recovering from a previous Rally Cry, or under the effects of Go Down Fighting.
>>
ABL_MEL_DESC: <<
	Uses special technology on the Admiral's flagship to mask the energy levels of a fleet, making them appear less powerful to an enemy's sensors. The deception must be maintained, though; every 5 minutes, the effect must be applied again.

	Reduces fleet's apparent DPS by 1000. Consumes 200 energy. Cannot stack.
>>
ABL_COUNTERINTEL_DESC: <<
	Uses a moderate amount of energy to disrupt the cloaking devices of saboteurs on a friendly flagship, orbital or planet and capture them. Also takes advantage of the empire's intelligence database to uncover and capture infiltrators from other empires aboard flagships.

	The operation costs §250k to perform.
>>
ABL_TURRET_LASER_DESC: <<
	Installs a laser turret onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turret's power generator prohibits the use of additional laser turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_TURRET_RAIL_DESC: <<
	Installs a pair of railgun turrets onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turrets' ammo fabricators, reloading mechanisms and induction coils prohibits the use of additional railgun turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_TURRET_MISSILE_DESC: <<
	Installs a dual missile turret onto a target flagship or orbital. The bulk of the turret's ammo fabricator prohibits the use of additional missile turrets on the object.

	Shares a cooldown with other turret construction.
>>
ABL_BUILD_OUTPOST_DESC: <<
	Uses a moderate amount of the empire's energy to immediately fabricate an outpost at a target location.

	Preparing the components required for the project costs §300k. Evangelical races construct a Star Temple instead.
>>
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT_DESC: <<
	Sends a demolition crew to plant charges on the target derelict. The remains of the target ship are destroyed.
>>
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY: Send Boarding Party
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY_DESC: <<
	Transports a boarding party to the target object, initiating a boarding action.
	
	Boarding takes between 10 (overwhelming force on either side) and 100 (completely equal numbers) seconds to complete. If the defenders are defeated, control of the object is immediately transferred to the attacking empire. If not, nothing happens.
	
	Only one boarding action can be running on an object at any given time, and Verdant-owned objects cannot be boarded. Boarding actions cannot be initiated by ships which are already being boarded. Asteroids and orbitals always have 100 boarding strength.
>>
ABL_RECALL_DESC: Opens a wormhole engulfing the target allied object and immediately depositing it in close proximity to the recalling object.
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES: Override Remnant Programming
ABL_PROGENITOR_COMMANDCODES_DESC: <<
	Using our command codes, we can access the control computers of Keeper fleets, overriding the ancient directives programmed by our ancestors so that they do our bidding.
	
	Properly reactivating the fleets will require some energy, though, and we do not have the codes for the great Guardians that watch over the Hubworlds.
>>
ABL_DEFENSIVEMATRIX: Engage Defensive Matrix
ABL_DEFENSIVEMATRIX_DESC: <<
	Engulfs an allied flagship in a charged plasma field, absorbing incoming damage until the field dissipates.

	Construct a number of orbital exploitation platforms to strip-mine a planet.

	Will automatically construct an amount of exploitation platforms to match the native resource level.
>>
ABL_CLOAK_DESC: <<
	Toggle whether the ship is currently cloaked.

	Cloaking makes the fleet invisible to anything more than 100 units away, but it costs a small amount of energy per second to maintain and breaks as soon as the fleet enters combat. Additionally, the fleet's sensor range is reduced by 65% at a priority of 500.
>>
ABL_ENGI_THRUSTER_DESC: <<
	Installs a set of maneuvering thrusters to the target orbital, giving it 1 u/s^2 of acceleration. Unfortunately, the system is too bulky to be installed more than once per orbital.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>
ABL_ENGI_SHIELD_DESC: <<
	Installs an array of shield generators onto the target orbital, giving it additional shield capacity dependent on its size and enough shield regeneration to regenerate the added shield to full capacity in 200 seconds. Unfortunately, the power requirements of the shield are too high for a second series of generators to be installed.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>
ABL_ENGI_SENSOR_DESC: <<
	Installs additional sensors onto the target orbital, giving it an additional 500 units of sensor range. However, the design of the sensors is such that the upgrade can only be performed once.

	Shares a cooldown with other Utility engineering upgrades.
>>

	Uses a moderate amount of energy to immediately fabricate a supply depot at a target location.

	Preparing the components required for the project costs §500k.
>>
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST: Prepare Planet for Harvesting
ABL_PREPARE_HARVEST_DESC: <<
	Tags any and all valuable resources on the planet surface for collection by a Ringworld. The process is a lengthy one; the beam must remain active for 6 consecutive minutes.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Deactivation of this ability, premature or not, incurs a 3 minute cooldown![/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Other Ringworlder empires can steal resources tagged by your ship.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Cannot target Barren planets, Ringworlds or Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
>>
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES: Harvest Planet
ABL_STEAL_RESOURCES_DESC: <<
	Simultaneously transfers all valuable resources from a target planet and onto the Ringworld. The planet is left a barren wasteland and can then be consumed by a Harvester.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Planets must be marked by a Harvester using the 'Prepare Planet for Harvesting' ability.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Vast Plains and resources generated by the presence of Altars, Megafarms and Hydrogenators will not be affected, though other resources on those planets will.[/img]
>>
ABL_MINE_PLANET: Devour Planet
ABL_MINE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	A series of tractor beams and mining lasers harvest minerals from a barren planet until the planet is destroyed.

	Rapidly produces Ore. Can only target Barren planets. 2.5k Ore is generated for every 1G of damage to the planet.
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_ACTIVATE: Activate Guardian Facility
ABL_GUARDIAN_ACTIVATE_DESC: <<
	Reactivate the shipyard, reaping many benefits but undoubtedly incurring the wrath of all but your most loyal allies and the blindest of fools.

	While active, the Guardian Facility's immense and ancient matter fabrication facilities can construct anything as if it were a planet, store up to 5000 Labor, generate 100 Labor per minute, produce 15 Research per second, and import Labor from other planets without any penalties. Alternatively, it can begin construction of a new Guardian.

	Unfortunately, while the facility does contain the blueprints required to construct a Guardian, they, just like any unfinished parts of the ship, are inaccessible. Learning how it works will have to be done when and if such a ship is completed.

	Upon sustaining critical damage for any reason, the Guardian Facility will revert to its deactivated state.

	[b][color=#f00]WARNING: Other empires will be immediately notified of the facility's reactivation, and are likely to launch an assault![/color][/b]
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_BUILD: Commence Guardian Construction
ABL_GUARDIAN_BUILD_DESC: <<
	Uses the ancient blueprints stored in the facility's databanks to construct the components for a powerful Remnant Guardian. This construction project will take a substantial amount of time and resources, and we will not be able to use the facility for any other purpose.

	Building a Guardian takes a minimum of 15 minutes, during which the Guardian Facility will no longer be able to use or store Labor, stop generating Research, and consume 10 Energy per second, 2.5 FTL Crystals per second, and incur a maintenance of §2M per budget cycle.

	Once ready, the Guardian's construction will require a bulk payment of 2000 Energy, 1000 FTL Crystals and §5M to finalize.

	[b][color=#f00]WARNING: Losing the Guardian Facility for any reason while construction is in progress will cancel the project without refunding any spent resources! Aside from this, there is no way of canceling construction of a Guardian, so be absolutely certain you want to do it!

	Additionally, other empires will be immediately notified when construction begins, and are likely to launch an assault![/color][/b]
>>
ABL_GUARDIAN_FINISH: Finalize Guardian Construction
ABL_GUARDIAN_FINISH_DESC: <<
	Assembles a Guardian from previously constructed modules. At this stage, if the galaxy has not already surrendered to you, it probably will; only the mythical 'Revenant' could reliably take on the combined forces of a Guardian and the rest of your empire.

	Furthermore, analysis of the completed ship will yield insights into its advanced technology, allowing us to design our own ships based on the Guardian's equipment.

	Other empires will be notified of the project's completion, and the Guardian Facility will resume normal operation.
>>
ABL_SPAWNARTIFACT: Construct Artifact
ABL_SPAWNARTIFACT_DESC: <<
	Instructs the Remnant computer controlling the remains of the crashed seed ship to assemble an artifact and launch it into orbit.
>>
