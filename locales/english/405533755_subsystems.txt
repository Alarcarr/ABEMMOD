SHIELDDIFFUSER_DESC: <<
	By channelling the shield energy through an array of micro-diffusion ports arrayed into a dish or dome-like structure, the recharge rate of the shield can be considerably boosted.  Unfortunately this does make the primary shield projector somewhat more vulnerable to overloading, reducing total effective capacity.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on shield subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ffea]recharge rate[/color][/b] of the shield.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Slightly increases the build and maintenance cost of the shield.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Decreases the [b][color=#fefc61]maximum capacity[/color][/b] of the shield.[/img]
	[i][color=#aaa]Placing more than one upgrade on a shield will continue to increase its abilities, but will also skyrocket its costs. Mixing upgrades will produce an overall better shield at a considerably higher cost.[/color][/i]

SHIELDCAPACITOR_DESC: <<
	By storing excess shield energy in an array of high-density capacitors, the shield's maximum absorption can be considerably boosted.  Unfortunately this inherently reduces the throughput of the recharge nodes, causing a moderate decrease in recharge speed.

POINTDEFENSEARRAY_DESC: <<
	A point defense array is a collection of linked micro-railgun batteries which fire in an almost continuous stream of projectiles.

	While each projectile is very small individually, together they can tear apart any lightly armoured target and are also excellent at collapsing energy shields through sheer weight of firepower.

	They do not have the target resolution to intentionally intercept missiles or torpedos, and suffer severely against targets with strong armor as they are entirely unable to pierce heavy damage resistance.

	[img=Plus][b]Extremely[/b] rapid fire rate.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Good initial projectile accuracy.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very short range.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Low per-projectile damage, does [b]ZERO[/b] minimum damage past damage resistance.[/img]
	[img=Minus]High supply usage when firing constantly.[/img]

S_NOVA_BOMB_DESC: <<
	A specially tuned gravitic implosion device best detonated deep inside the photosphere to cause plasma shockwaves capable of disrupting or destroying the target star.

	[img=Plus]System can be activated to cause the ship to dive into a star, dealing significant damage.  Cannot target planets.[/img]
	[img=Minus][b]Extremely[/b] dead.[/img]
	[i]Nova-bombs must be built into the ship's hull (taking up a significant portion of the internal capacity) with an exposed plasma intake/diffusion port in all six directions.[/i]
