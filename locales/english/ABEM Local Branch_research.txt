SUPPORT_REACTIVEARMOR_DESC: <<
	A sheet of independent explosives that detonate nearly instantly in response to incoming weapon fire, adapted for use on smaller support ships.

	[img=Plus]Damage hits exceeding the [b][color=#c33ac6]damage threshold[/color][/b] are reduced significantly.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b] of surrounding hexes.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Effective against massive single hits.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Small size makes the maximum damage reduction lower than on flagships.[/img]
	[img=Minus]High labor cost.[/img]

R_SYS_HYPERDRIVE_DESC: <<
	[i][color=#aaa]A device capable of opening a window into - or out of - hyperspace.[/color][/i]

	Unlocks the Hyperdrive subsystem for use on flagships if it is not already available.

	[i]Allows for hyperdrive navigation. The larger the hyperdrive the faster the FTL speed.[/i]

R_SYS_COVARIANT_BLURB: Anti-Burst Shield

R_SYS_FLAK_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Ages ago, explosive canisters filled with small bits of metal were used extensively in early ground-to-air weapons. Now, we can take that highly advanced knowledge, and bring down swarms of small craft with it.[/i][/color]

	Unlocks the Flak Cannon for use on flagships.

R_SYS_QUANTUM_ARMOR_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]After years of research, we have managed to improve upon Neutronium Armor. Most of this new armor's mass is stored outside our physical universe, only reappearing just before impact to withstand devastating blows without impairing mobility. Unfortunately, as this technology is applied to existing Neutronium Armor, the process is just as expensive as - and more difficult than - producing regular Neutronium Armor.[/i][/color]

	Unlocks the Quantum Armor subsystem.

R_ORB_FLING_DESC: <<
	[i][color=#aaa]A device capable of catapulting nearby vessels into hyperspace. The ships then proceed to exit from hyperspace under their own power.[/color][/i]

	Unlocks Fling Beacons if they are not already available.

	[i][bbloc=#ORB_FLING_CORE_DESC][/bbloc][/i]
>>
R_ORB_GATE_DESC: <<
	[i][color=#aaa]A space station capable of maintaining a node in an artificial wormhole network. Each gate network operates on a slightly different frequency, so fleets cannot use gates belonging to other empires.[/color][/i]

	Unlocks Gates and the Gate Constructor subsystem if they are not already available.

R_SYS_SLIPSTREAM_DESC: <<
	[i][color=#aaa]A device capable of penetrating subspace on a level far greater than - and considerably different from - conventional hyperdrives. 'Slipstream tears', while similar to wormholes, decay much more rapidly than known stable wormholes; with a bigger generator, the created rift will last longer.[/color][/i]

	Unlocks the Slipstream Generator subsystem if it is not already available.

	[i]Grants the ability to generate slipstream portals.[/i]

R_NANO_REPAIR_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]After many years of research, we have managed to found the nanotechnology. Most of this new nanotechnology repair is stored outside our physical universe, thus this will increase heal entire flagship or station. Unfortunately, as this technology is applied to existing normal repair, the process is just as expensive as - and more difficult than - producing normal repair such as crew.[/i][/color]
