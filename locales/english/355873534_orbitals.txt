ORB_SHIPYARD_DESC: <<
	A massive orbital shipyard capable of constructing fleets in space.

	Has 6 innate Labor generation per minute. Planets can export their own labor to shipyards within trade range at a 75% reduced rate.

	Gains Labor from Metallurgy factory research at a 75% reduced rate.

ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER: Power Transmitter
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_BLURB: System-wide Shield Recharge Buff
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful generators and emitters transmits additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors. However, shield activity disrupts the transmission beam, so combat will prevent continued charging.
	
	Increases the shield recharge rate of all ships in the system by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacity.
>>
ORB_TRADE_STATION_DESC: <<|
	A large and bustling station of commerce allows global resource trade between any territories with Commerce Stations.
	
	In addition, on each commerce station you can purchase a quantity of research, energy, influence or labor in exchange for money every 3 minutes. Commerce Stations also generate ยง40k for each friendly planet in the system they are located in, and allow all resources on an asteroid to be mined simultaneously.
	
	[i]Normally, planets in separated territories cannot export to each other. Construct a Commerce Station in both territories in order to allow import and export of resources from planets in your distinct territories. Similarly, asteroids can only mine one resource under normal circumstances, however a Commerce Station in the system will remove that limit.[/i]
