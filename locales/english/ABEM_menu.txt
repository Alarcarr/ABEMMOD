NGTT_LEGACY_EXPLORATION: <<
	When checked, entering a non-nebula system will immediately reveal everything inside, as if it were an unmodified game of Star Ruler 2.
	
	Sight range modifiers of all kinds will still take effect, though, making sensors useful when flying inside nebulae, flying a cloaked ship, or when searching for objects in interstellar space.
