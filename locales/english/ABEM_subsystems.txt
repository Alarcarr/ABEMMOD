BEAM_AMPLIFIER_DESC: <<
	Sophisticated targeting sensors and focused emitters allow a beam weapon to more accurately find its destination and deliver more power per second, increasing its effective range and armor penetration. Unfortunately, the new systems drain the weapon's capacitors faster, and the increased capacitor size is not matched by the power conduits feeding them.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on beam weapon subsystems.[/img]

>>
EXTRA_GUN_DESC: <<
	Sophisticated ammo feeds, power conduits, capacitors and emitters allow for two turrets' worth of weapons to be mounted on a single turret. While this conserves space and building materials, it is more difficult to assemble and maintain. In effect, beam turrets receive improved emitters which double the amount of energy they can channel, while other weapons receive a second barrel/launcher which is discharged halfway through the reloading process of the first one to maintain a consistent rate of fire.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on weapon subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Halves the reload time of non-beam weapons and doubles the damage of beam weapons, doubling DPS.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Construction cost is slightly lower than the price of building two separate weapon subsystems of the same firepower.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Somewhat increases Labor cost and significantly increases maintenance cost compared to building two separate weapons.[/img]

>>
S_SHIELDED_AMGEN_DESC: <<
