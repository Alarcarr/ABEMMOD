	The rate at which this ship regenerates Supply in combat. This is in addition to normal Supply regeneration.
>>
S_DEFENSEGENERATION: Defense Generation
STT_DEFENSEGENERATION: <<
	The amount of Defense generated by this ship. This Defense is used to construct support ships for the fleet.
>>
S_RESEARCHGENERATION: Research Generation
STT_RESEARCHGENERATION: <<
	The amount of Research generated by this ship.
>>
S_CHANNELPERCENTAGE: Channel Rate
STT_CHANNELPERCENTAGE: <<
	The rate at which resisted damage is channelled into the ship's shields.
>>
S_BOARDTOTAL: Boarding Defense
STT_BOARDTOTAL: <<
	The strength with which the ship will fight off boarders. This number must exceed the Boarding Strength of the attacking ship's Boarding Parties in order to survive a boarding action.
>>
S_BOARDSUBSYS: Boarding Strength
STT_BOARDSUBSYS: <<
	The strength this subsystem contributes to a boarding defense. Only Boarding Parties contribute to an offensive boarding action; their offensive strength is the same as their defensive strength.
>>
S_SENSORRANGE: Base Sensor Range
STT_SENSORRANGE: <<
	How far the ship can see, prior to the application of any multiplying effects such as entering a nebula, and prior to modification by the game's Global Sensor Multiplier.
	
	This does not necessarily have to be the actual range of the ship's sensors, but it might provide a good idea of how big that range will be.
>>
S_PLANETMININGRATE: Mining Rate
STT_PLANETMININGRATE: The rate at which this ship can mine materials from planets and put them into cargo storage.
STT_POWER: <<
	The minimum amount of Power required at all times for the ship to function, and the amount of Power generated by the ship's generators.
>>
S_OPTIMUMPOWER: Peak Power Consumption
STT_OPTIMUMPOWER: <<
	The amount of Power consumed when all of the ship's subsystems are operating. (Shield regeneration, abilities, or weapons fire - as well as some more specialized forms of armor taking damage.)
	
	Ideally, a ship should be capable of sustaining such a state for at least a minute using high Power generation, high Power storage, or a combination of the two. If there is not enough Power on a ship, its shields will stop regenerating, its weapons will stop firing, and various equipment will stop functioning!

	Ideally, this should be kept above one minute at the very least using high Power generation, high Power storage, or a combination of the two. If there is not enough Power on a ship, its shields will stop regenerating, most of its weapons will stop firing, and various equipment will stop functioning!

	NOTE: If this value is -1, then the ship generates more power than it is capable of consuming. Additional Power storage is typically not needed at that stage.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on beam weapon subsystems.[/img]

>>
EXTRA_GUN_DESC: <<
	Sophisticated ammo feeds, power conduits, capacitors and emitters allow for two turrets' worth of weapons to be mounted on a single turret. While this conserves space and building materials, it is more difficult to assemble and maintain. In effect, beam turrets receive improved emitters which double the amount of energy they can channel, while other weapons receive a second barrel/launcher which is discharged halfway through the reloading process of the first one to maintain a consistent rate of fire.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on weapon subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Halves the reload time of non-beam weapons and doubles the damage of beam weapons, doubling DPS.[/img]

	Adapting the technologies behind Quantum Armor allows us to transfer some of our supplies and ammunition out of our physical universe, to be brought back for use in combat and sieging planets.

	Unfortunately, refilling the system is an arduous task, and damage to the quantum displacers can cause some of the supplies to be lost completely.

	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides 220% more [b][color=#fefc61]Supply Capacity[/color][/b] than regular supply storage.[/img]
