BEAM_AMPLIFIER_DESC: <<
	Sophisticated targeting sensors and focused emitters allow a beam weapon to more accurately find its destination and deliver more power per second, increasing its effective range and armor penetration.

	[img=Plus][img=Minus]Does not count as an additional hex group in ship design, as opposed to two separate weapons - and does not increase hex health.[/img][/img]

	[img=Minus]Doubles the Supply cost of firing the weapon.
	[img=Minus]Only one module per subsystem.[/img]
>>

S_RECHARGERMODULE_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful emitters transmitting additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors.
	
	[img=Plus]Increases system-wide shield regeneration by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacities.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Additional regeneration does not apply in combat.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Only the core is required for the subsystem to operate. Additional hexes provide no benefits whatsoever.[/img]

	[img=Minus]Base fleet effectiveness is reduced by 50%.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Cannot be used on ships under size 50.[/img]

S_AUGMENT_RELOAD: Coolant System
S_AUGMENT_RELOAD_DESC: <<
	Augmenting the weapon's mechanism for reloading and cooling, faster fire rates can be achieved at the cost of fragility.

	[img=Plus]Increases [b][color=#c680ff]reload speed[/color][/b] by 20%.[/img]

S_AUGMENT_DAMAGE: Payload Amplifier
S_AUGMENT_DAMAGE_DESC: <<
	Augmenting the weapon's payload and energy allows for more damage to be dealt at the cost of range.

	[img=Plus]Increases [b][color=#ff8000]damage[/color][/b] by 25%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Decreases [b][color=#c680ff]range[/color][/b] by 20%.[/img]

S_AUGMENT_SUPPLY: Smoothed Mechanism
S_AUGMENT_SUPPLY_DESC: <<
	Augmenting the weapon's delivery and focusing systems decreases the supply cost of firing it at the cost of flexibility.

	[img=Plus]Decreases [b][color=#fefc61]supply cost[/color][/b] to fire by 30%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Decreases [b]turret firing arc[/b] by 50%, where appropriate.[/img]
>>
SHIELDDIFFUSER_DESC: <<
	By channelling the shield plasma through an array of micro-diffusion ports arrayed into a dish or dome-like structure, the recharge rate of the shield can be considerably boosted.  Unfortunately this does make the primary shield projector somewhat more vulnerable to overloading, reducing total effective capacity.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on shield subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ffea]recharge rate[/color][/b] of the shield.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Slightly increases the build and maintenance cost of the shield.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Decreases the [b][color=#fefc61]maximum capacity[/color][/b] of the shield.[/img]
	[i][color=#aaa]Placing more than one upgrade on a shield will continue to increase its abilities, but will also skyrocket its costs. Mixing upgrades will produce an overall better shield at a considerably higher cost.[/color][/i]
>>
SHIELDCAPACITOR_DESC: <<
	By storing excess shield plasma in an array of high-density containers, the shield's maximum absorption can be considerably boosted.  Unfortunately this inherently reduces the throughput of the recharge nodes, causing a moderate decrease in recharge speed.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on shield subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#fefc61]maximum capacity[/color][/b] of the shield.[/img]

>>
POINTDEFENSEARRAY_DESC: <<
	A point defense array is a collection of linked micro-railgun batteries which fire in an almost continuous stream of projectiles.

	While each projectile is very small individually, together they can tear apart any lightly armoured target and are also excellent at collapsing energy shields through sheer weight of firepower.

	They do not have the target resolution to intentionally intercept missiles or torpedos, and suffer severely against targets with strong armor as they are entirely unable to pierce heavy damage resistance.

	[img=Plus][b]Extremely[/b] rapid fire rate.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Good initial projectile accuracy.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very short range.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Low per-projectile damage, does [b]ZERO[/b] minimum damage past damage resistance.[/img]
	[img=Minus]High supply usage when firing constantly.[/img]
>>
S_NOVA_BOMB_DESC: <<
	A specially tuned gravitic implosion device best detonated deep inside the photosphere to cause plasma shockwaves capable of disrupting or destroying the target star.

	[img=Plus]System can be activated to cause the ship to dive into a star, dealing significant damage.  Cannot target planets.[/img]
	[img=Minus][b]Extremely[/b] dead.[/img]
	[i]Nova-bombs must be built into the ship's hull (taking up a significant portion of the internal capacity) with an exposed plasma intake/diffusion port in all six directions.[/i]
>>
S_ORB_EXP_DELIVERY_HULL_DESC: <<
	Orbital Exploitation Delivery vessels convert themselves into an appropriate amount of Orbital Exploitation Platforms to cover all planetary resources.

	Planetary resources can then be exported to any friendly ringworld.  When exploitation is finished (or on command) the delivery vessel can pack up the platforms and move to another target.

	[b]Exploitation Delivery vessels cannot fire or use supports! Do not put guns or support cap on them![/b]

	[img=PlanetType::32;22][b][color=#1c9bb4]Only available when the 'Reclusive Ringworlders' race option is chosen.[/color][/b][/img]
>>
S_SUPERSTRUCTURE_DESC: <<
	Light-weight metal scaffolding to give structure and definition to the ship.  Somewhat more resistant to damage than most other components, but not as protective per-weight as actual armor.

	[img=Plus]Moderate [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Slightly resists and reduces incoming damage.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Superstructure on the outside of the ship does not use up interior space.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Cheap.[/img]
>>
S_ORBITALTHRUSTER_DESC: <<
	A large scoop that collects particulate matter floating in space and uses it to propel the station.

	[img=Plus]Lack of fuel requirements makes its maintenance requirements negligible.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Extremely low thrust.[/img]
>>

ERROR_SPECIFIC_SIZE: $1 must be exactly size $2.
