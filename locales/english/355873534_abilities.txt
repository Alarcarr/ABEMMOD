	Effectiveness boost starts at 10%, increasing by 5% every 5 seconds until the ship explodes 60 seconds after activation. Explosion deals damage equivalent to the square root of 5*Power to all targets within a radius of the square root of 2*Power units. Cannot be used on a fleet that is under the effects of - or recovering from - Rally Cry.
>>
