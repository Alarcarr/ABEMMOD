S_ORB_EXP_DELIVERY_HULL_DESC: <<
	Orbital Exploitation Delivery vessels convert themselves into an appropriate amount of Orbital Exploitation Platforms to cover all planetary resources.

	Planetary resources can then be exported to any friendly ringworld.  When exploitation is finished (or on command) the delivery vessel can pack up the platforms and move to another target.

	[b]Exploitation Delivery vessels cannot fire or use supports! Do not put guns or support cap on them![/b]
