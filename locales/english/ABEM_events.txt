EVT_NOTIFY_HUBWORLD: Progenitor Archives Reactivated on [color=$4]$3[/color]!
EVT_NOTIFY_HUBWORLD_DESC: The [color=$2]$1[/color] have reactivated a Progenitor archive on [color=$4]$3[/color]! Tremendous knowledge is just a step away from their scientists!
EVT_NOTIFY_PROGENITOR_BREAKTHROUGH: Progenitor Resurgence
EVT_NOTIFY_PROGENITOR_BREAKTHROUGH_DESC: The [color=$2]$1[/color] have begun rediscovering their most advanced technology!
EVT_PROGENITOR_BREAKTHROUGH: Technological Breakthrough!
EVT_PROGENITOR_BREAKTHROUGH_DESC: <<
	After a long and arduous process, we have finally rediscovered enough of our old knowledge to have a contextual understanding of the remnants of our database.

	Finally, we can start taking our first steps towards rebuilding and improving upon the great wonders of our past!

EVT_VANGUARD_PORTAL: Portal Stabilizer constructed on [color=$4]$3[/color]!
EVT_VANGUARD_PORTAL_DESC: <<
	The [color=$2]$1[/color] have constructed a Portal Stabilizer on [color=$4]$3[/color]! Quickly, capture the planet to destroy the Stabilizer; if they own three Stabilizers simultaneously, they will summon the Overlords!

EVT_GUARDIANSHIPYARD_FOUND: Analysis Complete
EVT_GUARDIANSHIPYARD_FOUND_DESC: <<
	Detailed analysis of the device found near the Guardian has led to the conclusion that it has a dual purpose. Firstly, it is a nav beacon.

	Secondly, it has transmitted some kind of signal to a location in the system. Investigation of the signal has allowed us to discover a gargantuan, phase-shifted facility at those coordinates - the beacon must have been intended to allow contact with the facility. Unfortunately, the facility's phase cloak has partially deactivated itself; other empires will be able to detect the structure as well!

EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP: A Dying Sower
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_DESC: <<
	A Remnant seed ship drifts into one of your star systems, on a collision course towards [target=Location/]. Sensor scans of the vessel indicate that it has already been badly damaged by weapons fire, and cannot alter its course.

	Leaving the ship alone is out of the question - at its current speed, the impact would decimate the planet's population and render it borderline uninhabitable for decades. The planetary militia has sent several teams to the ship - they can plant explosives to destroy the ship - disperse its remains before it comes too close to the planet - and salvage valuable equipment after the charges are set, but the team leader suggests that there may be a few alternative solutions.

	He believes that a series of controlled detonations can, with the help of their shuttles' thrusters, provide enough thrust in just the right places to slow the ship and safely bring it down to the surface for study. However, execution of this plan would require the ship to come dangerously close to the planet - if it fails, the outcome will undoubtedly be as disastrous for the colony as if they had done nothing.

	Alternatively, they might be able to bring the ship's engines back online and send it on its way - such an effort, however, would demand the militia's full attention, and if unsuccessful, prevent any significant salvage operation from taking place.

	What should they do?
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_SCRAP: <<
	Proceed with the salvage operation. There's no reason to expect the alternate plans will get us anywhere.
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_SCRAP_SUCCESS_TITLE: Playing it Safe
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_SCRAP_SUCCESS: <<
	Once the charges are set, the remaining time until detonation is spent salvaging the ship. By the time the ship explodes, the militia is quite satisfied with their findings. One team manages to salvage a damaged matter fabricator from the seed system - another successfully procures several high-capacity power cells while the others gather a wide range of components and valuable metals.

	All in all, a nice find and a job well done as far as everyone on [target=Location/] is concerned. All of the resources have been forwarded to the proper authorities.

	[b]Gained a moderate amount of Energy, Research, and Special Funds. Also gained a moderate quantity of Labor on [target=Location/][/b]
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_LAND: Make preparations for the landing, but evacuate as many people as possible, just in case.
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_LAND_SUCCESS_TITLE: Grounded
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_LAND_SUCCESS: <<
	It is a close call, but the plan works. Eventually, the seed ship reaches the surface of [target=Location/] more or less in one piece, and while the landscape in its wake cannot say the same, everyone is fine.

	Your scientists are confident that you can learn much from the ship - some have already begun establishing an interface with the ship's computer to trigger its artifact fabrication routines. While that part of the ship's functionality remains effectively a black box, it is still a valuable asset.

	[b]Gained +2 Research generation and a +10% bonus to civilian Research production. Additionally, [target=Location/] can now occasionally construct random artifacts![/b]
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_LAND_FAIL_TITLE: Extinction
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_LAND_FAIL: <<
	As the ship approaches [target=Location/], it becomes far too obvious that nothing can be done to stabilize its descent - but it is too late. The charges are detonated to break the ship apart; regardless, as the debris hurtles down towards the surface, it leaves nothing but death and devastation throughout the planet. Casualties are numbered in the billions - the ecological damage, however, is just as bad. The planet is just barely habitable now, and though your technology is advanced enough to compensate for the problem to a degree, it cannot negate the effects completely.

	[b]Up to 2 billion inhabitants killed. [target=Location/] has significantly reduced population capacity for 180 seconds.[/b]
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_REPAIR: Repair the ship, but try to reprogram its computer before it leaves.
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_REPAIR_SUCCESS_TITLE: A Different Destiny
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_REPAIR_SUCCESS: <<
	The away teams manage to repair the engines. Detecting the threat, the ship's computer quickly alters course away from the planet - but not before your personnel manage to program in a few command overrides and instruct it to dump several artifacts into the system. You can now exercise control over the ship for brief periods of time, directing its movements to a certain degree - and better yet, it is now transmitting a transponder code identifying it as part of your empire, so it will not be fired upon by allied forces!

	[b]Gained a Seed Ship and three random artifacts near [target=Location/].[/b]
>>
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_REPAIR_FAIL_TITLE: A Missed Opportunity
EVT_BROKENSEEDSHIP_REPAIR_FAIL: <<
	Despite the best efforts of your people, the repairs do not go well. In the end, the ship is destroyed after all, and while [target=Location/] has been saved from this threat, the fact remains that you have gained nothing from this. No salvage, no technology...

	[b]Nothing.[/b]

	Your mission has failed. The Overlords will not be pleased.

	As the portal opens, the Overlords' fleet emerges. Your completion of your mission will undoubtedly see your race gain great prestige.
	
	There are those in this region that continue to fight us. It does not matter, for the supreme might of this new armada will exterminate all resistance, and [color=#0f0]victory[/color] shall be ours...

	The portal opens, and the Overlords emerge, leading an armada of insurmountable might. Your race may gain prestige today, but it pains you greatly that you were forced to give the $1 the honor of allowing the Overlords' arrival.
	
	There are other races that do not recognize the power the Overlords represent. Perhaps you can still curry some favor with your great masters by shattering pockets of resistance; if you do not, they or your competing races most certainly will...

V_VANGUARD_LESSEROTHER_TEXT: <<|
	As a vassal empire, you have helped the $1 subjugate this this galaxy in the name of the Overlords. They will continue their efforts to bring forth your masters, but you cannot gain any prestige here anymore; only try to avoid losing it while you wait...

V_VANGUARD_LOSTOTHERSUCCESS_TEXT: <<|
	The $1 has [color=#f00]defeated[/color] you; beaten you to it. How many of your forces remain is of no consequence now; all that matters as the Overlord fleet emerges from the portal is that your failed efforts to take this great honor for yourself have caused you to lose all of it.
	
	Your race will be purged, a fate even worse than what awaits those empires that still resist; perhaps you could still save yourselves by allying against the Overlords...
>>
V_VANGUARD_LOSTOTHER_TEXT: <<|
	The $1 has [color=#f00]defeated[/color] you and conquered the galaxy. For now, they rule in the Overlords' name, and if you survived, you have time to reflect upon the mistakes you have made, and upon the grisly fate that awaits you when the portal is opened...

	You saw the wisdom of assisting the $1 in their quest. You are somewhat nervous about the arrival of their 'Overlords'; while your race will survive past this dreaded day, they will now be enslaved.

	You saw the wisdom of assisting the $1 as they conquered the galaxy. Now, they act as stewards for the 'Overlords' they spoke of. Your race has survived, but it now exists only in slavery.

	The day you have feared for so long has finally come. The $1 have succeeded in their quest to summon the so-called 'Overlords'.
