TRAIT_VANGUARD_RINGWORLDER_DESC: <<
	[vspace=3/][img=PlanetType::14;28]Instead of planets, starts with a Ringworld and the technology to build more.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::3;22]Cannot own non-Ringworld planets. This includes Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::2;22]Bulky Harvesters prepare planets for harvesting by Ringworlds, which steal all non-building resources from the planet's surface and turn it into a barren world.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::4;22]Harvesters can Devour barren planets, producing vast quantities of Ore and damaging the planet over time.[/img]
