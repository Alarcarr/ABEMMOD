  [vspace=3/][img=techHyperfield;22]Cannot attack or be attacked by Remnant ships, but can use the Override Remnant Programming ability to take control of non-Guardian Remnant fleets.[/img]
  [vspace=3/][img=ResourceIcon::4;22]Researching enough technologies allows access to Progenitor tech tree, opening up powerful new techs without the requirement for a level 6 Ancient Hubworld.[/img]

  [vspace=3/][img=StatusWar;22]Centuries of conflict have resulted in a 25% increase in fleet effectiveness and a 25% reduction in supply costs.[/img]
  [vspace=3/][img=SystemUnderAttack;22]All planets are Happy when at war with another empire. All civilian non-Influence generations are increased by 5% when at war, and all civilian resource generations are halved when not at war. All planets receive +0.5 Defense generation when at war.[/img]

TRAIT_VANGUARD_RINGWORLDER: Vanguard (Ringworlders)
TRAIT_VANGUARD_RINGWORLDER_DESC: <<|
	[vspace=3/][img=PlanetType::14;28]Instead of planets, starts with a Ringworld and the technology to build more.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::3;22]Cannot own non-Ringworld planets. This includes Artificial Planetoids.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::2;22]Bulky Harvesters prepare planets for harvesting by Ringworlds, which steal all non-building resources from the planet's surface and turn it into a barren world.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=QuickbarIcons::4;22]Harvesters can Devour barren planets, producing vast quantities of Ore and damaging the planet over time.[/img]

TRAIT_VERDANT: Verdant
TRAIT_VERDANT_DESC: <<|
	[vspace=3/][img=Sinew;22]Ships must be held together by organic [b]Sinew[/b], providing control instead of having a bridge.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=Sinew;22]Ships, orbitals and asteroid mines cannot have or be targeted by Boarding Parties. Also, cannot use Improved Command Decks.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=BuildingSprites::0;22]Does [b]not[/b] have any form of cities.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=AttributeIcons::0;22]Must construct [b]Stalks[/b] on planets to be able to use pressure.[/img]

TRAIT_STAR_CHILDREN_DESC: <<|
	[vspace=3/] [img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Population grows only on giant [b]Motherships[/b] that have construction capabilities.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=ActionBarIcons::1;22]Motherships can move population to orbital [b]Habitats[/b] around planets, letting them use the planetary resources.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=Industrious;22]The society's emphasis on survival in space results in an abundance of skilled shipwrights and better equipment, yielding a 15% decrease in build, labor and maintenance costs for all ships and orbitals.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=BuildingSprites::0;22]Does [b]not[/b] use planet surfaces in any way. Planets cannot construct anything.[/img]
	[vspace=3/][img=ResourceIcon::6;22]Resources are produced in orbit, no pressure capacity is needed. Motherships in orbit of a planet automatically gain that planet's labor income.[/img]
