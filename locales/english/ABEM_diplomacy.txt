CARD_INTELLIGENCE_DESC: <<
	Anonymously releasing intelligence obtained against one of the other empires lets us create opposition for their position without revealing our identity.

	Alternatively, we can use this intelligence to try to discover the identity of enemy operatives on our flagships or planets - or those of our allies, exposing and removing them.

	[b]The support added by this card is anonymous and cannot be traced back to you.[/b]

	[i]Can only be played if the $1 has voted on the opposite side of the proposition. Each subsequent intelligence against the same empire played in the same vote loses 2 weight.

	You can only have 3 Intelligence about one empire at any time. If no intelligence is being actively generated, your existing intelligence will expire over time.

	Any Intelligence can be used outside of a vote to remove infiltrators planted by the "Infiltrate" ability; but be certain that the target has been infiltrated, and be careful not to remove your own infiltrators.[/i]
