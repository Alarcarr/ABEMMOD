	Name: Equipment Stash
	Frequency: 0
	Model: ResearchStation
	Material: ResearchStation
	Option: Weapons
		Icon: FusionTorpedo
		Description: This container is full of advanced capacitors, warheads and cannons. Analysis will undoubtedly provide a 10% boost to weapon damage.
		AddModifier(tag/Weapon::DamageFactor(1.10))
	Option: Supply
		Icon: SupplyStorage
		Description: This container is mostly full of ammunition. While it is incompatible with our weapons, it is remarkably well stored and compressed; we could learn to improve the capacity of our supply stores by as much as 20%!
		AddModifier(SupplyCapacityFactor(1.2))
	Option: Engines
		Icon: techRocket
		Description: This container houses advanced engine injector assemblies, fuel lines, thrusters and similar engine components. Reverse-engineering them will boost all thrust by 10%. (Does not apply to Planetary Engines.)
		AddModifier(ThrustFactor(1.1))
	Option: Armor
		Description: This container is filled with advanced alloys and composites used in armor fabrication. Analyzing them will yield a 15% boost to all armor health.

		Narrative: <<
			This station appears to have served as a resupply facility for the creators of the robotic 'Remnants'. It is now dormant, but your scientists believe they can command the station to jettison one of its supply containers into space, allowing you to analyze the advanced technology within. They are also certain that they have deciphered the cargo manifests, so they know what the contents of each container are.
			
			Unfortunately, this will trigger a self-destruct mechanism, destroying the other containers and the station itself. You must decide what sort of technology you require most.
